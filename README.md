<h1>Folder Encryption</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Today's demonstration will show you how to encrypt folders in Windows like a pro. As a network administrator, you know the importance of safeguarding sensitive and confidential data from unauthorized access. By encrypting folders, you can ensure that only authorized users have access to the information they need. And don't worry, I won't leave you hanging. I'll also be showing you how to grant specific user rights in your network, so you can have complete control over who has access to your data. Let's get started!
